Introduction

dSkull is a rules system designed for dungeon crawling and skirmish games with emphasis on fast playing and minimum of bookkeeping. It supports 3 main styles of play, Adventure (coop), Nemesis (one versus many) and Skirmish (warband creation). Each of these styles of play can be played as Single Scenario or as a Campaign (series of linked scenarios).

Playing the Game
- Players will control one or more figures
- Players will activate one of their ready figures in Initiative order
-- Every player belongs to a side, for example Nemesis or Heroes.
-- Activate one figure per side until all sides with ready figures activated one figure, then repeat until all figures ware activated
- Activated figure will gain and then use actions

Initiative order
- Order in which players take their turns.
- Initiative order includes "sides" not players
-- In Nemesis mode, Nemesis and Heroes are 2 sides.
-- In Skirmish, every player represents a side.
- Losing Initiative
-- In skirmish, moves players side to end of initiative order
-- In other modes, player can activate last
-- In case multiple players lost initiative, they act in order they lost initiative

Activating Figures
- Only ready figures can be activated
- Figure becomes ready at the start of the round.
- When activated, figure gains 2 actions and 1 free interact.
- Actions can be spent to gain movement points, attacks and interacts
- Free Interact is not the same thing as Interact
- Interact can be used in place of Free Interact.
- Free Interact cannot be used in place of Interact

Movement
- You refers to figure
- using movement action gives you 4 movement points
- you move by spending movement points.
- you move one space at a time.
- you may move using adjecent spaces only
- during movement, you lose engagement zone. This mostly affects movement point cost
- moving to adjecent space costs 1 MP.
- moving through Impeding Edge costs 1 additional movement point.
- you may enter space occupied by ally. It costs 1 additional movement point.
- you cannot end your movement inside space occupied by another figure
- you cannot end your movemeny inside space that is surrounded by blocking edges
- you may do multiple movements during your activation
- movement ends when you decide to attack or interact. You may continue moving after resolving attack or interact.


Attack
- Attacker refers to figure making the attack and player that controlls that figure
- gaining attacks
-- in most cases, for every attack action you gain 1 attack with primary weapon, every 2 attack actions in an activation you gain 1 attack with your secondary weapon
-- number of attacks are written as n/m
-- during your activation, every odd attack action gives you n attacks, every even attack action gives you m attacks
-- you gain attacks separately for your primary and secondary weapon
- Every weapon has has it's Base Dice.

- Targetting
-- Figure
--- Used for most attacks
--- Valid targets differ depending on Attack Type
-- Space
--- Used for AoE attacks
- Melee Attack
-- You may target adjacent figures (adjacent up to 1)
-- You may target figures inside your engagement zone
- Ranged Attack
-- You may only target figures (or spaces) you have LoS to.
-- distance
-- base range
- Indirect Attack
-- Targets space
-- AoE
-- cover adds to defenders armor
- Multi Attack
-- Burst

Distance between spaces
- shortest path between 2 spaces not counting starting space but counting target space

Adjacency
- Spaces are adjacent if they share non blocking edge (or corner if they share no edges)
- Adjacent up to X
-- Spaces are "adjacent up to X" if there is a path of adjacent spaces with distance X or less between them.

Line of Sight (LoS)
- Chose one non obscured corner of your space
- Draw imagionary lines between chosen corner and every corner of targets space.
- count every line that is not crossing Obscuring edge or corner
- if lines overlap, count only one line per overlap.
- depending on grid type and number of counted lines
-- square grid
--- 3 or more lines, full LoS
--- 2 lines, light cover
--- 1 line, heavy cover
--- 0 lines, no LoS
-- hex grid
--- 4 or more lines, full LoS
--- 3 lines, light cover
--- 2 lines, heavy cover
--- 1 or less lines, no LoS
- cover
-- penalty to ranged attack
-- bonus on Armor against Indirect Attacks

Engagement Zone
- Engagement zone has size property
- if not specified, Engagement Zone has size of 1
- Melee Trait gives you Engagement Zone (with size of 1)
- figure or space is inside your engagement zone if it is adjacent up to your engagement zone size to you

Harm
- results from attacks
- levels of harm by damage
-- 0 or less: No effect
-- 1: Stunned Condition
-- 2: Wounded Condition
-- 3: Incapacitated Condition
-- 4 or more: Mortally Injured Condition
- Figure can have only 1 Harm condition at the same time
- If figure should gain same level of Harm or less it must keep its current Harm condition 
- Stunned condition
-- You may not spend actions except to remove this condition. Spend 1 Action, remove this condition.
- Wounded condition
-- You may not spend actions except to remove this condition. Spend 2 Actions, remove this condition
- Incapacitated condition
-- Followers are removed from the board
-- Heroes are removed from board in Skirmish
-- Incapacitated Heroes in Nemesis or Adventure game modes
--- Hero is considered defeated
--- You gain Wounded Condition
--- For the rest of scenario, at the end of your activation you gain Stunned Condition
- Mortally Injured
-- If not using campaign variant, same as Incapacitated
-- If using campaign variant, use Injury Deck or Injury Table


Space
- Edges
-- Space is enclosed by edges
-- Movement is through edges
-- Edge can be Obscuring
-- Edge can be Impeding or Blocking, never both
-- 
- Corners
-- On square grid, movement throug corners is allowed
--- Every odd move through corner during activation costs double MP
-- Corner is Obscuring if at least two adjacent edges are Obscuring
-- Corner is Impeding if at least two adjacent edges are Impeding
-- Corner is Blocking if at least two adjacent edges are Blocking
-- If corner is Impeding and Blocking, it is only Blocking
- Obscuring
-- Affects LoS
-- Can be combined with Impeding or Blocking
- Impeding
-- Affects movement
-- Moving through impeding edge costs 1 additional movement point
-- Can be combined with Obscuring
- Blocking
-- Affects movement
-- Affects Adjacency
-- You can't move through blocking edge
-- Spaces that share blocking edge (or corner) are not Adjacent

Area of Effect (AoE) Attacks
- Target spaces instead of figures
- 

Figure types:
- Followers
-- Use standard rules for everything
- Heroes
-- Use most of the same rules as Followers
-- Can use Endurance
-- Can use Valor/Edge (name depends on setting)
-- Can have special Heroic Traits
-- Use advanced equipment rules

Modes of Play
- Adventure
-- Cooperative, players play against the game
-- Each player plays 1 Hero
-- Can be app driven
- Nemesis
-- One versus many, Nemesis versus Heroes
-- One player plays Nemesis
-- Other players play Heroes
- Skirmish
-- Every player creates his own warband
-- Players compete for specific Scenario Objectives

Endurance
- Heroes have maximum of 3 Endurance
- Unless otherwise stated, hetoes start every scenario with max Endurance
- At the beginning of your activation, recover 1 Endurance up to your maximum endurance
- during your activation, you may spend 1 Endurance to gain 1 Movement Point
- during your activation, you may spend 2 Endurance to gain 1 attack
- before any attack or interact (including free interact) that requires a roll, you may spend 2 Endurance to get +1 Die Step on that roll.
- before Harm test, you must spend Endurance to lower damage as much as you can with 1 Endurance lowering damage by 1
- when spending Endurance you may combine different sources of Endurance
- sources of Endurance
-- Alert status
-- Endurance
-- Valor/Edge
- Rest/Prepare action
- Special action that can be used by Hero only
-- you may use rest/prepare action to recover 1 Endurance
-- if you are at max Endurance you may rest/prepare to gain Alert status
- Alert status
-- does not stack, only 1 instance
-- behaves like Endurance but must be spent before other sources of Endurance

Valor/Edge
- same thing, different settings
- Heroes gain it with experience
- behaves like Endurance but can't be recovered during Scenario
- if you did not negate full damage by spending Endurance before Harm test, you must spend available Valor/Edge
